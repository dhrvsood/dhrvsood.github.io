# **Hello!**

<!-- ![Dhruv Sood](../assets/img/headshot.jpg){:width="100"} -->

I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a full stack engineer based in San Diego with a passion for music and education. I graduated from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in December 2022 with a B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science and minors in Cognitive Science & Music. 

One of my favorite aspects of software development is the opportunity to collaborate with people from a wide range of disciplines. I love learning new things and connecting with people across a range of industries, so feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:dhruvsood27@gmail.com) if youâ€™d like to get in touch!
